CxJS and Tailwind CSS mix really well together. CxJS brings JavaScript based application elements such as widgets, charts, state management, and routing, while Tailwind CSS offers a rapid way to combine these elements into higher-order visual structures - page elements, headers, toolbars, sections, layouts, etc.

Both products require time to understand and master, but once everything settles, the productivity that this combination brings is amazing.

This repository offers working examples of application layouts, sample page implementations, component gallery, Babel and webpack configurations, and others bits and pieces related to Tailwind CSS integration with CxJS.
